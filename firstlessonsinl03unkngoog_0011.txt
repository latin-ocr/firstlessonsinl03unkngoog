PREFACE. ⁶ V

necessary to give a list of the introductory bookS, grammars, edi-
tions of Caesar, and lexicons — American, English, and German
— which have been consulted in its preparation. Some things
which appear to be com'mon property have been adopted without
credit. s 1 may here express my sincere thanks to kind friends
for enco‘uragement and practical suggestions3 to the University
Press of Cambridge for great patience and pains in secur-ing typo-
graphical excellence 5 and especially to my publisherS‚ Messrs.
S. C. Griggs ἅ Co, of Chicag0‚ for sparing no expense to produce
a school-book unsurpassed in mechanical execution,

These Lessons are offered to the public with much hesitation,

but with the hope that they may prove serviceable to some

teachers and beginnerS.
