The division of the above introductory matter into suiteble Iessons is left
to the teaeher. He may find it necessary at first to go over each lesson in
advance with the class and point out the portions designated. The follow-
ing suggestion is offered. Each definition should be made practical by
application. E. g., as soon as the leerner has committed to memory the
'portione of grammar referred to under ⁴⁴1. Alvhssbe⁶s” he should turn to
“ Lusson 1.”. and classify the letters of the Latin words there found. After
learning “29” he should pronouuce the same letters in accordance with the

rules under “29'’ and divide the words which they form into syllables-
zeum thorouohly ,- retiano often ‚- use the blaokboard.
