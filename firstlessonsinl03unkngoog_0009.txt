‘PREFAOE.

Tlmsn· Lessons are intended as a practical drill-book for the
beginner in Latin. They aim to make him familiar with the
ordinary Latin inflections and the simpler principles of Latin
syntax3 to teach him as many words and expressions from
Caesar's Commentarios as he can learn with profit, and thus
prepare him for the successful study of that work.

References are made to six of our best Latin grammars, with
any one of which the book may be used. In the part devoted
to inflectiom the learner’s attention is directed, as far as thought
practicable, to the elements of words declined and conjugated,
—- to -stems, endings, signs, and connecting vowels, The root
and formation of stems are not referred to; these subjects be-
long more properly ¹0²⁰ a later stage of the study. In syntax,
the principa] rules only are introduced, and these are illustrated
by numerous examples. Of the latter, translations are given
which the learner may imitate in rendering the parallel exer-
cises that follow3 these exercises are taken chiefly from the
Commentaries and accompanied by explanatory notes. English
exercises to be turned into Latin are also added3 these are so
formed that the Latin sentences immediately preceding furnish
models for their construction.
