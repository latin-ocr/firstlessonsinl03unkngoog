“ We certainly have no American essayist who surpasses Prof. Mathews in adoming
his pages with ample and elegant illustrations. They are perhaps unequalled for pol-
ish and pungency.” —New york Home Journal.

“They are written in that charming and graceful style which is so attractive in this
author's writings, and the reader is continually reminded by their ease and grace of the
elegant compositions of Goldsmith and Irving. . . . . We commend the volume to all
lovers of good writing, who enjoy the luxury of an easy, flowing style, and who love to
be instructed while they are entertained-’⁹ — Boston Transcrzspt.

‘⁸ Tbese essays are on divers subjects, biographical, literam and social, and show an
unusual combinatiou of information, good sense, and good writing. The style is their
great charm. It is easy, clear, happy. and forcible. It entertains the reader whatever
subject is treated, and the satisfaction is all the greater because what is so delightfully
said is of itself so well worth saying. Once one begins to read he is beguiled on and
on.'’ — ¹Boston A dvertzteer.

“ He touches lightly on an immense number of subjects, he darts from flower to flower
with the rapidity of the bumming-bird, but with all his versatility he is rarely. if ever,
superficial or crude, showing a, habit of reflection and a refinement of taste that betray
the cultivation of the scholar no less than the curiosity of the book-fancier. The work
is an excellent one, and could have been produced by no one but a scholar of great read-
ing, cultivated tastes, and prompt decision of choice.'’ -New York Tribmoe.

“ No one can possibly read the polished essays of Prof. Mathews without feeling that
he has entered into a cultivated circle, and is privileged to share the communion of one
who has touched the hem of the charmed garment. In the society of this skilfnl artist,
the reader is led into the presence of living memories. One by one they pass before
him, a processioa of intellectual majesty, and, led by the hand of a trusty guide, he
meets and is introduced to the men of whom he has heard or read, or whose works he
may have studied. The essays of Prof- Mathews are among the most delightful that it
has ever been our pleasure to read.'’ - Chic-ago Inter-ocean.
