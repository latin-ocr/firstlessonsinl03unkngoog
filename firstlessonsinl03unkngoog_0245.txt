‘⁸ Though written with great simplicity‚ it is evigiently the productiori ,of a master
mind, . . . . and few works are more adapted to bring scepttcs of a certain class to a
stand ..... It is the disclusure of the actual process of mind through which the author
passa, from the dark regions οξ doubt and infitielity to the clear hght and conviction

‘⁴ No single volume we ever read has been so satisfactory a demonstration of the truth '

of religion, or has had so strong a controlling influence over our habits of thought .....
No better book can be put into the hands of the honest and intellectual sceptie. It is
overwhelmingly convincin to reason, and leaves the doubter nothin but his passions
and prejudices to bolster iiim up ..... Every minister’s library shoulgd have a copy.” -

“The author's former able works have repared the public sor the rich treasures of
thought in this volume. It is a book of oundation principles, and deals in the verities
of the gos l as with scientific facts. It is an unanswerable argument in behalf of
Christ’s lie. mission. and doctrine, and especially rich in its teachings conceming the
office and-work of the Spirit. No volume has lately issued from the press which brin s
so many timely truths to the public attention. While lt is metaphysical and morungi·
it is also elever, forcet'ul. winning for its grand truth’s sake, and every way readable.
The author has wrou ht a great work for the Christian Church‚ and every minister and
teacker should arm imself with strong gweapons by perusing the arguments of this
book. It is printed and bound in the exquisite style osan publications which issue from
Messrs S. C. Griggs 81. Co.’s establishmeut.'' -· Methodist Remmia, Pam-burgh.
