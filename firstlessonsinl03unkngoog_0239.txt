'non-With References to Hadley's, Goodwin‘s‚ and Taylor’s-Kiihner’s Greek Gram-
mars, and a full English-Greek Vocabulary. Part 1. By Eusm Jonas, M. A„ iate
Professor of Greek, University oi' Miehigan, (now of Germany.) Price, 8 Loo.

Extracts from the Preme: “These exercises in prose composition are designed
for 8 sustentatio driu in the more important principles of Greek syntax ..... They
are also intended to accompany the reading of Xenophon's Anabasis, from which are
taken 811 oi’ the vocabularies and nearly aii the exemplos. Wherever practicabie ihi
exercises themselves are so framod that, with the use of the Anabasis, Xenophon’s
style may be imitated in turnzng them into Greek. 'l'o aid in securing thoroughness, each
exercise after the fourteenth not only comprises the prinpries referred to in its own iesson,
but also reviews those in at least two of the preceding. The purpose of this repetition, ne-
cessary for the young student, is to make him 8ο familiar with the principai peculiarities
of Greek construction, that he may be able to appreciate somewhat the beauties οἵ Xeno-
phon, and also better prepared to enter upon 8 more advanced study of tho language.

‘³ it is believed that Part 1. contains sufficient work in prose composition for admission to
any American college.”
